# DIP
digital image processing
this repo has got all the tinkering that i did with opencv saved onto it..
The commits till the next update in this readme are all during a stage when i was exlporing the package 
all on my own before and without being formally introduced in my actual undergrad syllabus..
so please do with the noobie that i am in image processing at this phase...
Every master was once a beginner.
